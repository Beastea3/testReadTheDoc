# Git better practices for teams

## Formalize Git conventions for your team

- Use aliases to formalize team membersâ€™ actions;
- Build a standard for git committing/branching/tagging.

## Rebase & Merge

### Rebase your feature branch often;
```bash
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout feature-new  # name of your hypothetical feature branch
git rebase master  # may need to fix merge conflicts in feature-new
```
After the commands above, your branch should not have any conflicts against `master`. Then you can create a PR to merge your code to `master`;

```bash
git checkout feature
git pull
git merge feature-new
```
The commands above are aimed to merge your feature branch to a `feature` branch, which is integrated with many features including other colleagues' code.

### The difference between `merge` and `rebase` is critical:
 - `merge` has a non-linear history, and will generate "Merge Commit" to make the git history difficult to follow and read;
 - `rebase` will hand on all commits of this branch to the `master`, and will have a cleaner project history. However, `rebase` will be tricky because it will rewrite the history and will be tougher to resolve conflicts;

### To Rebase or To Merge?

If you are working on a local and individual branch which no one else is looking at or using your branch to base their works, it will be best to rebase your branch; Otherwise, it will be dangerous because `rebase` will rewrite the commit history. Moreover, rebasing as frequently as you are committing will be a good solution for complicated rebases;

`git merge --squash` is also a good choice to merge feature branch, it will squash all your commits into one commit to make the merge meaningful and consolidated. What's more, `--squash` can also give you an opportunity to select which files you want to merge.

### git pull

`git pull` runs `git fetch` and `git merge`, but if followed by a `--rebase`, it will run `git rebase` instead of `git merge`;

## Bug Fixing

### git bisect

It is very annoying to find when the code was broken. Now the code is not working, and you know that at commit `b18271663a8117`, the code works well. `git bisect` can accelerate your progress to reach the incorrect point. The workflow is sampled below:

```
$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
$ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2    # v2.6.13-rc2 is known to be good

Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)  # Output
$ git bisect good # If this commit is good;
$ git bisect bad # If this commit is broken;

Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps) # Output

$ git bisect reset # go back to HEAD
```

`git bisect` uses a binary search to locate the point at which the code is broken;

## Branching Strategy

Agile recommends three branches strategy:
  - Release
  - Feature
  - Task

Since Agile is user story centered, every task including bug-fix or feature should have its branch, which is named by the story id;

### Branching's evil twin

Short-lived branches make it easier to merge branches. because with short-lived branches simply contain fewer changes. Under this strategy, "merge hell" will not affect our development;
