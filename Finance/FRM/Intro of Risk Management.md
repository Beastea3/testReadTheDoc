### Credit Risk may increase if:
 - Less and large amount of loan instead of more and small amount of loan; 
 - The loans are highly positively correlated;
 - ~~Macroeconomics fall down~~ The expossure, loss given default and probability of default are positively correlated;


### Liquidity Risk is used to describe two separate risks:
1. Funding Risk;
2. ~~Specific Market Liquidity Risk~~ Trading Liquidity Risk;

**Operation Risk** is the risk resulted from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events;

### The Process of Risk Management:
1. Identify
2. Analyze
3. Assess Impact
4. Manage

### A series of choices to deal with the risks:
1. Avoid, change startegy to avoid potential risk;
2. Retain, according to firm's appetite, to acheive more reward.
3. Mitigate, diversifying the asset, or using derivatives to hedge positions;
4. Transfer, Eg. buying insurance. 

### 4 Risks(Known versus Unknowns):
1. Expected Loss;
2. Unexpected Loss;
3. Knightian Uncertainty(Known Unknowns Eg. Nuclear wars that can not be quantified);
4. Unknown Unknowns;

### Expected Loss can be calculated by:

EL = LGD(Loss Given Default) * Probability of Default(PD) * Explosure at Default(EAD)

### VaR: Value at Risk;
  - Firstly used by JP morgan to assess the amount of loss in a given level of confidence;
  - Fall down if tail is fat;

### 3 Lines to defend large Unexpected Loss:

1. Business line risk management;
2. Risk management commitee;
3. Internal audit;

### Risk-adjusted return on capital(RAROC):
  - RAROC = Reaward / Risk
  - RAROC = After Tax Net Risk-Adjusted Expected Return / Economic Capital
